1. Peers used algorithms fairly similar to mine. They were along the
theme of using doublings effectively to get from a^1 to a^p. Mine differed
from theirs mostly on the basis of how we decided which numbers to multiply.
I used a bitwise and operation to see if a particular power of 2 was in the
exponent, and they used something more akin to a right shift of bits.

2. Changes I made were in response to criticisms regarding redundant use of
arrays and useless commenting. Arrays were removed and comments were cleaned
up. Suggestion about modifying line 15 so that particular values of p don't 
result in an infinite loop was ignored - any p large enough to cause that
error would have also caused an overflow problem in result.
