\subsection*{10.5}
We have $\cov(nF_n(u),nF_n(v))=\cov(\sum_iI_u(X_i),\sum_iI_v(X_i))=\sum_i\sum_j\cov(I_u(X_i),I_v(X_j))$. Note that the term inside is zero unless $i=j$ since $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent otherwise. Then, we get the sum $\sum_i\cov(I_u(X_i),I_v(X_i))$. We have $\cov(I_u(X_i),I_v(X_i))=E(I_u(X_i)I_v(X_i))-E(I_u(X_i))E(I_v(X_i))$. The second term is given in the book to be $F(u)F(v)$. If we assume WLOG that $v\leq u$, then the first term is $1$ iff $I_v(X_i)=1$, so its expected value is just $F(v)=F(m)$. Thus, we have that $\cov(nF_n(u),nF_n(v))=nF(m)(1-F(u))$ or $\cov(F_n(u),F_n(v))=\frac{1}{n}F(m)(1-F(u))$
\subsection*{10.6.a}

The data are on the $x$ axis and the normal quantiles are on the $y$. The line $y=x$ has been drawn. This looks a bit off-normal at the ends, and the direction suggests that it has more spread than a normal distribution.
\subsection*{11.11}
Under $H_0$, we have $\mu_X=\mu+\Delta$ and $\mu_Y=\mu$, where $X$ and $Y$ are independent normal RVs both variance $\sigma^2$. Thus, the $t$-statistic 
$$\frac{(\bar{X}-\bar{Y})-\Delta}{s_p\sqrt{1/n+1/m}}$$
has a $t$-distribution with $n+m-2$ degrees of freedom. Then, we can just determine an appropriate cutoff for the level we're testing at with for this statistic.
\subsection*{11.34}
Let $\delta=\mu_X-\mu_Y$. For both designs, we wish to plot $P(\text{reject }H_0|\mu_X-\mu_Y=\delta)$ versus $\delta$. Set a significance level of $0.05$ for both.

\noindent a. Under $H_a$, $\bar{D}=\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$ is normally distributed with mean $\delta$ and variance $\sigma_D^2=\sigma_X^2+\sigma_Y^2-2\cov(X,Y)=100$. We reject the null hypothesis when $\bar{D}/\sigma_D$ goes outside the interval $(-1.96,1.96)$, so the probability of rejection is $P(\bar{D}>19.6)+P(\bar{D}>-19.6)$.

\noindent b. Same as above, except $\sigma_D^2=\sigma_X^2+\sigma_Y^2=200$ now, so the probability of rejection is now $P(\bar{D}>1.96\sqrt{2})+P(\bar{D}>-1.96)$

The unpaired design is less powerful than the paired design for all values of $\delta$ except $0$.

\noindent b. The standard deviations at 0h are pretty different, so we can't use the pooled $t$-test. At 0h, it also looks like the data isn't very normal, so that could be a problem. At 0h, if we test the equality of the means, the $t$-statistic is $2.222$ with approximate dof $22$, so we get a $p$-value of $0.037$.
At 2h, the $t$-statistic is $2.693$ with approximate dof $24$, so the $p$-value is $0.0127$. The differences have a $t$-statistic of $1.818$ and a dof of $29$, so the $p$-value is $0.794$. If we're at $\alpha=0.05$, there's not enough evidence to suggest that the difference is different between the two groups.
