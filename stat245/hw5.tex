\subsection*{10.5}
We want to compute $E(F_n(u)F_n(v))-E(F_n(u))E(F_n(v))$. The expected values of $F_n(u)$ and $F_n(v)$ was given in the book to be $F(u)$ and $F(v)$, resp. In considering the first term, suppose WLOG that $u\geq v$, so that $m=v$. Then, we have $nF_n(u)=\sum I_{(-\infty,u]}(X_i)$ and $nF_n(v)=\sum I_{(-\infty,v]}(X_i)$, so $n^2F_n(u)F_n(v)=\sum_i\sum_jI_{(-\infty,u]}(X_i)I_{(-\infty,v]}(X_i)$. Each term $I_{(-\infty,u]}(X_i)I_{(-\infty,v]}(X_i)$ is a Bernoulli RV with probability of success $F(v)$, since it equals $1$ iff both are $1$, but since $u\geq v$, we only need the second part to be positive. Then, $n^2F_n(u)F_n(v)$ is binomial with $n^2$ trials and probability of success $F(v)$, so $E(F_n(u)F_n(v))$ is just $F(v)$.

The data are on the $x$ axis and the normal quantiles are on the $y$. The line $y=x$ has been drawn. This looks a bit off-normal at the ends, and the direction suggests that it has more spread than a normal distribution.
